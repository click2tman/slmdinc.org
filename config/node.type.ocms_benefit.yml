description: 'A "Benefit" post is ideal for creating and displaying Benefits of your offerings to clients. A Benefit can be displayed in the front-page slideshow. It also comes with the capability of attaching an image which is automatically adjusted to fit into the website layout. Whatâ€™s particularly cool about a Benefit post, is that it provides the ability to attach a series of images, thumbnails of which are automatically created and adjusted to fit into the website layout. Lastly, a Benefit post enables free tagging (just like labels), helping you make the most from the built-in taxonomy system.'
